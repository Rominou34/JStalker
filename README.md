This script is an improvement of [Eligrey's awesome Object.watch().js script](https://gist.github.com/eligrey/384583)

Basically, he did all the hard work, I forked the script and made it more good-looking with more functions, but still props to him, I would never do this alone because I'm still pretty much a newbie
